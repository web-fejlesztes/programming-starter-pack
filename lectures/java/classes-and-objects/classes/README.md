### Theoretical and Practical material

#### What problem `class` solves?

Basic data types in Java include `int`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`.
While these are fundamental, the complexity of real-world scenarios often extends beyond such elementary values.
For instance, consider the task of managing a library's collection of books.
In this context, a book is characterized by various attributes, such as its title,
author, publisher, price, and ISBN number. These attributes collectively define a book, but they cannot be adequately
represented using only the basic data types like `int` or `char`.

To effectively represent, for example, a book (or any object from the real-world)
in a software application, a more comprehensive data structure is needed.
This requirement leads to the creation of a new type, known as a `class`, in Java.
A `class` is a custom data type that encapsulates all the necessary attributes like
title, author, and price and behaviors associated with a
book, thereby providing a more accurate and useful representation in the context of the application.

#### What is a `class`?

A `class` is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
In the example the `class` will be `Book` a new data type, what developers can create.
One instance of a `Book` class will be one specified book,
like one book of `The Lord of the Rings` or `Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone` or any other books.

> [!CAUTION]
> The `class` is not an object. And the `class` is not like a class or classroom in the school.

#### How to create a simple class?

We need to create a new file with the name of the class and the `.java` extension.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The name of the file should be the same as the name of the class.

The name of the class should begin with a capital letter and follow the Upper CamelCase (also known as Pascal Case)
naming convention.
The following code snippet illustrates the syntax of a class declaration.

Let's create a new file called `Book.java` and write the following code into it:

```java
class Book {
    // class body: attributes and methods will be here later in the next sections
}
```

A class is created using the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class which is `Book` for now.
The name of the class should begin with a capital letter and follow the Upper CamelCase (also known as Pascal Case)
naming convention
therefore the name of the class is `Book`.
The body of the class is enclosed within a pair of curly braces `{}`.
In the body of the class, we can define the attributes and behaviors (methods) of the class.
We will learn about attributes and methods in the next sections.

#### Class name naming conventions

- **Case**: Upper CamelCase (Pascal case)

> [!NOTE]
> Upper CamelCase (Pascal case) is a naming convention in which the first letter of each word in a compound word is
> capitalized. For example: AudioSystem

- **No Spaces or Underscores**: There are no spaces or underscores between words. Each word is directly connected to the
  next, with their boundary indicated by a capital letter.
- **Descriptive and Intuitive**: Class names should be nouns and are often descriptive of what the class represents. For
  example: `Book`, `Car`, `Person`, `Student`, `Employee`, `Customer`, `Account`, `Bank`, `Library`, `School`, etc.
- **Singular Form**: Generally, class names are in singular form, unless they specifically represent a collection of
  items. If a class represents a collection or list of items, then the name of the class should be in plural form.

#### How can we create an instance of a class?

The instance of a class is called an **object**, which represents a real-world entity.
We can create a book in any method, but for now, we will create it in the `main` method.

Let's create a new file called `Main.java` beside the `Book.java` file
and write the following code into it:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Book theGift = new Book();
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You will learn about the `public`, `static` keywords later

So the structure of creating an object is the following: `ClassName objectVariableName = new ClassName();`.

It works like any other variable declaration and assignment.
The variable `theGift` is declared with the type of `Book` and assigned with a new instance of the `Book` class.

Let's break it down:
Assignment in Java works from right to left.
The **right side** of the assignment operator `=` is the creation of the object, creation of an instance of the class.
An instance of a class is created using the `new` keyword followed by the name of the class.
The syntax for creating an instance of a class is similar to invoking / calling a method.
The `new` keyword is followed by the name of the class, and it's followed by a pair of parentheses `()`.
Like methods, the parentheses are followed by a semicolon `;`.

The **left side** of the assignment operator `=` is the declaration of a variable.
So we declare a variable with the name of `theGift` and the type of it's `Book`.

#### Instance naming conventions

- **Case**: (Lower) camelCase
- **No Spaces or Underscores**: There are no spaces or underscores between words. Each word is directly connected to the
  next, with their boundary indicated by a capital letter.
- **Descriptive and Intuitive**: Instance names should be nouns and are often descriptive of what the instance
  represents.
- Example instance names: `theGift`, `endrewsCar`, `myAccount`, `cityBank`, `ervinLibrary`, `harwardUniversity`, etc.

These naming conventions make the code more readable and easier to understand, as they help to distinguish between
classes and instances. For instance, you can differentiate between a class name `Car` and an instance of this class
`endrewsCar`. This clarity in naming is important for writing maintainable and clear code.

#### Can we create multiple instances of a class?

Yes, we can create as many instances of a class as we want.
Let's create another instance of the `Book` class in the `main` method.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Book theGift = new Book();
        Book theLordOfTheRings = new Book();
    }
}
```

#### What is the difference between a class and an instance of a class?

In simple terms, if a class is like a blueprint, an instance is like one of the houses built from that blueprint. The
blueprint (class) can be used to create many houses (instances), and while they all follow the same design, each house
can have its own unique characteristics.

## Next step

In this case, the `Book` class and their instances don't have any attributes like title, author, and price.
We will add them in the next section: [Fields or Properties or Attributes](../fields-properties-attributes/README.md).
